# StudyNotes-3D-vision

## Overview

This repository collects the studies on 3d vision, secificly include papers related to neural radiance field and BEV perception. This is my personnal recording of my learning materiall and note.

Overall, the paper collection is organized as follows.
- [Nerf](#Neural radiance fields)
  -[]
- [BEV perception](#BEV perrception)
  -[Preliminaries](#Preliminaries)
  -[3D detection](#3D detection)
  -[3D semantic seg](#3D semantic seg)
  -[3D detection + semantic seg](#3D detection + semantic seg)
  -[Spatio + temporal BEV](#Spatio + temporal BEV)
